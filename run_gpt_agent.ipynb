      "The EX-Z120 camera is designed to bring the fun and convenience of digital photography to people everywhere with user-friendly features that are true to Casio's tradition of cutting-edge technology, intelligent functionality, and high-quality photography. A powerful Exilim engine puts high-resolution, low-noise digital imaging at your fingertips. A 7.2-megapixel resolution combines with an 8-mode dial that gives you simple access to manual setup, an easy mode for one-touch snapshots, movie recording, and more. Also, an Anti Shake DSP (digital signal processor) minimizes image blur due to hand or subject movement. Two widely available AA-size batteries (alkaline) provide enough power to record 170 images. You can use lithium or rechargeable nickel metal hydride batteries for power.  Use the bundled cable to connect the USB/AV port to a computer for easy data transfer. You can also transfer images using a commercially available SD memory card reader/writer. Easy Mode Easy mode lets you shoot snapshots without worrying about troublesome settings. Flash, image size and self-timer settings are displayed on compact menus. Simply select a setting and shoot. Three advanced features minimize image blur and ensure perfect pictures Anti Shake Image blur due to hand or subject movement is minimized thanks to faster shutter speeds that are enabled by the higher sensitivity of a new Anti Shake digital signal processor built into the Exilim Engine. The effects of hand movement are reduced even when shooting indoors where lighting is dim. The effects of subject movement are reduced for beautiful images. Auto Macro If the subject is in the range of 10 to 50 centimeters, for example, the camera will switch to the Macro Mode automatically, even if the Auto Focus Mode is currently selected. This helps to ensure that your images are always in focus and reduces the chance of focus error.  Quick Shutter When you press the shutter button all the way without pausing, Quick Shutter focuses the image immediately. This lets you capture fast-moving action, and also eliminates the chance of focus error when you ask someone else to record an image for you. With normal recording, the moment is missed waiting for the camera to focus. When Quick Shutter is turned on, you capture the moment as it happens. A person who is not familiar with camera operation often records a blurred image. When Quick Shutter is turned on, you don't need to worry if someone presses the shutter button too quickly. Image capture The EX-Z120 combines high resolution (7.2 megapixels), an 8-mode dial for simple access to manual setup, an \"easy mode\" for one-touch snapshots, movie recording, and more. An Anti Shake DSP minimizes image blur due to hand or subject movement. Use the bundled cable to connect the USB/AV port to a computer for easy data transfer. You can also transfer images using a commercially available SD memory card reader/writer.  Select-and-shoot Best Shot scenes A single screen shows 12 Best Shot sample scenes, which makes it easier to find the one you want more quickly. This scene produces clear shots with a bright background, even when lighting is dim. It also prevents image blur due to hand or subject movement.  Manual settings make picture taking more fun Aperture adjustment The aperture can be adjusted to blur the background or to bring everything into sharp focus and create exactly the image you have in mind. Settings are manual, so you maintain total control over your images. Shutter speed adjustment Changing the shutter speed setting controls how movement appears in an image. You can use a slower speed so movement produces a blurred effect, or a faster shutter speed to freeze the movement of a drop of water or other moving subjects. There is even a bulb setting that keeps the shutter open as long as the shutter button is depressed. Style/design The Exilim EX-Z120 includes an elegant and durable stainless steel body. Keys for manual settings and a highly intuitive controller button are carefully arranged on the camera's back to keep everything you need just a click away. Anti-Shake DSP Image blur due to hand or subject movement is minimized thanks to faster shutter speeds that are enabled by the higher sensitivity of a new Anti Shake digital signal processor (DSP) built into the Exilim Engine.\n",
